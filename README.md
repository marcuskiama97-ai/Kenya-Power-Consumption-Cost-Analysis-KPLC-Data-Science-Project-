## **Project Summary**

This project analyzes Kenya Power (KPLC) energy consumption data across major regions and customer types. The goal is to uncover **regional consumption trends**, identify **distribution inefficiencies**, and simulate realistic **customer level, county level, and national trends** to inform operational decisions and policy planning.

The project combines **data cleaning, transformation, visualization, simulation, and dashboarding** using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI.

---

## **Objectives**

- Analyze energy consumption patterns across counties and customer types  
- Identify high consumption areas and distribution inefficiencies  
- Provide actionable insights for energy management and cost optimization  
- Simulate realistic trends at multiple levels: customer, county, and national  

---

## **Tools & Technologies**

- **Python** – data cleaning, transformation, and simulation  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and aggregation  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** – visualizations and trend plotting  
- **Power BI** – interactive dashboards and KPIs  
- **SQL** – data extraction and querying  
- **Excel / CSV** – handling raw datasets and intermediate files
